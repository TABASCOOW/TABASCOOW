## üëã Hi, I‚Äôm TABASCO ([Ethan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethan-f))
As the Developer Relations Team Lead at Chainstack, I guide a passionate team dedicated to supporting and empowering developers in leveraging our high-quality Web3 infrastructure. Together, we're helping developers innovate without the constraints of low-quality infrastructure. Learn more about Chainstack here: https://chainstack.com

I'm also the solo developer behind Amity DeFi, an innovative project bridging EVM chains with Discord communities, creating a new dimension of community interaction powered by blockchain. Discover Amity DeFi at: https://www.amitydefi.one

Some of my recent projects include:

‚Ä¢ Developing a novel methodology to optimize and measure Developer Relations ROI for SaaS/PaaS, successfully implemented within Chainstack.

‚Ä¢ Pioneering a patent-pending, directly-biometric Web3 authentication and identification infrastructure, enabling seamless biometric interaction with blockchains through real-world terminals; intertwining physical and on-chain identity.

‚Ä¢ Creating an innovative approach to quantify developer activity within a specific protocol, done through the large-scale indexing and qualifying of public code repositories.

‚Ä¢ Building a (currently verified) ChatGPT plugin that utilizes JSON-RPC requests, the Covalent API, and the Chainstack platform API to provide developers with a new medium of interaction with blockchain data.
