As a response to the different tip-bots scattered throughout communities, all with different intricacies and supported tokens, Amity DeFi was made to be an all-in-one tip bot that works with every token on Harmony.

Amity DeFi has been in development since March of 2021 and is currently in its final Beta version (v5).
Through the bot, you own an entire wallet, compatible with not only Harmony but every Ethereum-compatible network.

You can send, receive, giveaway(rain), and burn any token on the network via. contract address. Additionally, you can view important statistics like contract information, transaction information, addresses, and prices of different coins (via. Coingecko)

‚Äì In essence, Amity DeFi is like Metamask, but built ground-up to serve various discord communities.
